The [Van Gogh letters](https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/art-and-stories/stories/all-stories/van-goghs-letters) offer a view into the painter's innermost thoughts, sources of artistic inspiration, and relationships. More than 100 years since the publication of the letters, Van Gogh's writings can be understood in new ways thanks to the large langugae models. In particular, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) creates an opportunity to "talk to" a corpus of documents. This repository post is a learning project in which I create a RAG pipeline based on the Van Gogh letters, demonstrating how such an approach enhances the performance of large language models on domain-specific questions.
